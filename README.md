* Copy or download my code from [Here](https://github.com/kimieouyang/project_fortuneteller2020/blob/master/projectfortuneteller05082020.py), and paste or upload to the editor
* Connect the assembled microbit device
* Flash the code to the device
* You are good to go!

### How to use this Fortune Teller
* Power up your machine and read the instruction of how to use it
* Cover and shake the machine’s LED panel part to start the “asking” process, once it starts the process, you would be able to see the universe is “listening” by showing the animation
* After you are done asking your question, press any button near the LED screen to complete asking
* The universe would respond you an answer on the LED screen with delightful background music while you are reading the message
* Once you are done reading the message, the music would also stop and the machine (universe) is ready for another question from you
